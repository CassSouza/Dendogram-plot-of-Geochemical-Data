# Hierarchical Clustering - Dendogram

Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data into a tree of nested clusters. The hierarchical cluster analysis helps find patterns and connections in datasets. Results are presented in a dendrogram showing the distance relationships between clusters (the distance between the elements is directly proportional to the correlation between them. Elements within a cluster have similar affinities and behaviors).

## About the data
The __['data.csv'](https://github.com/CassSouza/Dendogram-Plot-/tree/main/Data)__ dataframe consist of real world data that has been subjected to a clr (centered log-ratio) transformation. Labels and features have had their names changed to generic names in order to preserve the source of the data.

## Hierarchical Clustering analysis and plot

The code necessary for the hierarchical clustering analysis and plot are available in the __[Dendogram.py](https://github.com/CassSouza/Dendogram-Plot-/blob/main/Dendogram.py)__ file. 

Below, the dendogram plot generated by the code:
